# MoleDwave
Moleculer simulation using a Dwave 2000q

Predictions/Goals

Hello my name is Julian Herrera this is the github repo for my MoleDwave Project.
This consistes of three main open source components, a molecule container converter to a quantum machine readable format
and a simulator designed to be as optimized as possibe, these molecule are very complex and we hope to mabye simulate about 3-8 atoms.
The last component will be error checking and correcting system to either be ran on a classical home computer (such as my gaming laptop) or a powerful cloud computer. This project is led by me but anyone can join and help if they talk to be from now to april 13th. We have no code yet but I will keep you updated.
